Introduction
------------

`Accessibility <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accessibility>`_ is building 
things that are fully usable for people with disabilities. `There are 
many reasons to prioritize accessibility <https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-intro/#important>`_ , 
including ethical, user experience, and legal motivations. Accessibility 
is also a long-recommended web standard (via `WCAG <https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG/>`_).

Refer to the `draft SPEC associated with this effort <https://scientific-python.org/specs/spec-0003/>`_
for more information.

Global accessibility guidelines
-------------------------------

There are accessibility guidelines that extend beyond the Scientific Python 
ecosystem; we respect those first and foremost. This includes

* `Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (W3C) <https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG/>`_

Please note that in many cases guidelines serve as a foundation for 
accessibility efforts. They are by no means the limit of what is needed to 
create enjoyably accessible work.

Scientific Python recommendations
---------------------------------

For cases where ecosystem-specific recommendations are needed or examples of 
accessibility within the ecosystem are helpful, we also provide resources 
designed to support the needs of our community.
