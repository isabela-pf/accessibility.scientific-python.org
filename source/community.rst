At the time of writing, accessibility is not a regular consideration in many 
Scientific Python projects. Many projects may have a handful of people who 
have accessibility knowledge or are interested in accquiring more, but may not 
be able to reach critical mass on a per-project basis. Connecting Scientific 
Python community members focused on accessibility will provide a boon for 
individuals, projects, and the ecosystem at large. 

Working with the community may include activities that

* Make the ecosystem more accessible 
* Clarify the broad term accessibility and its variouspossible implementations
* Provide specific assessment tools and steps
* Direct to existing accessibility standards and modifications for open source 
    specifically 
* Provide case studies of how different core projects became more accessible
* Start discussion and develop shared solutions
